# 🔌 LED Blink Circuit on Breadboard (Tinkercad Simulation)
🧾 Description
This project demonstrates a basic LED circuit built on a breadboard using a 9V battery, resistor, and LED. The purpose of this setup is to understand how to safely power an LED using an external power source and learn about current limiting using a resistor.

## 📦 Components Used
- 1 x Breadboard

- 1 x 9V Battery

- 1 x LED (Blue)

- 1 x Resistor (330Ω or appropriate for LED)

- Jumper wires

## 🔧 Circuit Explanation
- The positive terminal (+) of the 9V battery is connected to one leg of the resistor.

- The resistor is connected to the anode (long leg) of the LED.

- The cathode (short leg) of the LED is connected back to the negative terminal (-) of the battery.

- This forms a complete loop allowing current to flow and light the LED.

## ⚠️ Safety Note
A resistor is necessary to limit the current flowing through the LED to prevent it from burning out. The typical forward voltage of a blue LED is around 3.0–3.2V, and the resistor ensures that the remaining voltage from the 9V battery is safely dropped.

## 🛠 Platform Used
Simulated using Tinkercad Circuits.
